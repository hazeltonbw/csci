====================================================

Purpose: This assignment is to teach you about making classes, classes in
vectors and passing classes to functions.

Idea: This is a simple game. There is a 101x101 field (minimum -50, maximum 50
in both the x and y location) that has buried treasure within it. The player
who will start at the origin (0,0) will take steps around the field and dig
at up to five spots. If there's treasure at that spot, the player wins however
much money is in the treasure there. Once the player digs five times the game
is over and their total score is printed to the screen.

There are two phases to this game. The first is the loading phase - given a
file name, you will load treasure data from that file into the game. The
treasure data file holds a series of lines of data like this:
0 0 4 4 900
30 30 40 50 1000
-10 20 -10 20 700

These correspond to the minimum x value (the leftmost column that the treasure
is on), the minimum y value (the bottom row that the treasure is on), the
maximum x value (the rightmost column the treasure is on), the maximum y
value (the top row the treasure is on), and finally how much the treasure is
worth. All variables are ints.

The smallest treasure is 1x1, such as the "0 20 0 20" above, which is on
column -10 and row 20.

The second line (30 30 40 50 1000) defines a rectangle that has (30,30) as its
bottom left corner and (40,50) as its top right corner. (Note that (30,30) and
(40,50) are both considered inside the rectangle.)

Errors: You should be checking for errors as you process this file. If you
find any errors, print "BAD INPUT!" and quit. Possible errors include:
1) A maximum value smaller than the minimum value
2) Two treasures on the same spot
3) Treasures outside the bounds of the world
4) Treasures must be worth at least one dollar
5) The filename not being valid
6) Non integers in the file

In phase two, you will print something this over and over until they run out
of digs:
You are at location (-20,30). You have 5 digs left. Do you wish to (D)ig or
move (N)orth, move (S)outh, move (W)est or move (E)ast?

If they dig and there is nothing there, print:
Sorry, no treasure was here.

If they dig and there is treasure there, print:
Congrats! You found 900 dollars!
(Where 900 is replaced with how much treasure is there.)

If they dig up the same treasure again, print:
You found an opened treasure chest, unfortunately.

If they walk off the edge of the world, print "BAD INPUT!" and quit.

When they've done their fifth dig print:
You won a total of: XX dollars!
(Where XX is replaced with their total value dug up.)
