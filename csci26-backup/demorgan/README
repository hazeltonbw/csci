Debugging complicated if statements is a pain.

For this assignment, you must simplify the if statements as much as possible,
while still maintaining correctness.

Basically, you must write a "you" function that will have the minimum number
of characters in it.

The program will test the correctness of your function against mine, and then
output to you.txt the number of characters it took you.

Then do it again for you2(). (I.e. match correctness of me2() in the minimum
number of characters.)

1) YOU MAY ONLY EDIT THE FILE BETWEEN THE PAIRS OF CUTPOINTS
2) IF YOU PUT ANY CODE OUTSIDE THE COMMENTS SHOWING WHERE TO WRITE YOU WILL GET A
ZERO.
3) You are welcome to eliminate whitespace to save on characters
4) You are welcome to use preprocessor macros to eliminate characters, but
remember, they must still be within the cutpoints.
5) Do not just copy and paste my if statement without simplifying it.

Scoring is based on correctness and total character count:
Correctness:            7 points
<= 69 characters:      +5   points
70 to  79 characters:  +4.5 points
80 to  89 characters:  +4   points
90 to  99 characters:  +3.5 points
100 to 110 characters: +3   points
111 to 120 characters: +2   points
121 to 130 characters: +1   points

10 points = 100%

If you want to see your current score, type "cat you*" and add up the two
numbers
