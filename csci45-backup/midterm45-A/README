====================================

For this assignment you will implement a simple program that will shift a
number left or right.

The user will first type in the number to shift.
They will then type in how many digits to shift it.
Then they will type either an odd number (which means shift left) or an even
number (which means shift right)

The program then outputs the result and terminates.

All numbers are regular 32 bit signed integers.

Remember left shifting by one bit is the same as a multiply by 2, and a right
shift (we should always do arithmetic right shifts) is the same as division by
2.

There is a compile bug, and a logic bug. You need to fix both in main.s.

Sample runs:

====================================

Enter three numbers.
1) A number you want to shift.
2) How many binary digits you want to shift it.
3) An odd number means shift left, an even number means shift right.
