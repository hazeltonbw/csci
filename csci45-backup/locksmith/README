You are given a short assembly program which is a disassembled version of a program which has copy protection on it.

The copy protection mechanism works like this:
1) It prompts the user for a password which must be a number
1.1) If the input is not a number, it complains about this.
2) If the password is wrong, it prompt a second and final time
3) If both guesses are wrong, it exits
4) If either guess is correct, it prints a welcome message (and then quits, since I don't actually have a game here).

Your assignment:
1) Make it accept any number as a correct password.
2) It should still reject a word or letter.
